# SEM_fiber_analysis
This repository contains python scipts to perform fiber analysis in SEM images.
It uses [scikit-image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image) and [quanfima](https://github.com/rshkarin/quanfima) for the analysis, [dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) for lazy-loading and parallelization, and [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) for intermediate outcome visualization.
A Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step example of the image analysis workflow, using a representative SEM of bacterial cellulose fibers.
